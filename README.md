# Game Boy DMG: USB-C Charging Kit PRO

The **Game Boy DMG USB-C Charging Kit PRO** is a new circuit designed specifically for the **Nintendo Game Boy**. This all-in-one circuit includes not only the **charging controller** but also a **boost converter** and **audio amplifier**.

The modern **IPS displays** with backlighting require more power than the original display, and **flash cards** used to load tons of games can quickly drain the battery. To truly enjoy the games, it is recommended to use a rechargeable battery instead of AA batteries.

However, simply using a rechargeable battery is not sufficient. The increased power consumption puts a strain on the original electronics, potentially causing noise in the speaker or headphones.

The typical solution is to add a charging circuit for the battery and a power converter to replace the old, inefficient one included in the GB. Some individuals also add an audio amplifier to enhance the sound quality of the speaker. All these modifications make the GBP function optimally. However, installing them requires numerous cables and may be challenging for individuals without sufficient knowledge.

This board adds all these features with a clean and straightforward installation:
